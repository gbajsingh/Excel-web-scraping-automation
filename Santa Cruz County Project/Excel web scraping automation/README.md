# Excel-web-scraping-automation

Developed a tool to autofill the excel cells with web query result. To accomplish the task I created a macro in excel by writing a Visual Basic script. The script takes the information(Property Addresses) from range of selected cells; navigates to the desired website, performs a query on the website and extracts the results back into the spreadsheet.

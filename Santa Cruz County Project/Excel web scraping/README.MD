# VBA/excel-web-scraping


Wrote a script that extracts "Property Addresses biodata" from a website and saves it in excel. Script can be copied to your own Excel VBA environment and can be executed as a Macro. Or, simply download the Excel file that contains the script.

# Flow work
1. Script takes the information(Address) from the spreadsheet.
2. Submits a web-form (@Propertyshark.com).
3. Extracts the desire data from the resulting page and saves it back in the spreadsheet.


*To run select those cells that needs to be fill and press Ctrl + R.

*In case the script is interrupted while running, the script would pick up back from the same row it has stopped when ran again.

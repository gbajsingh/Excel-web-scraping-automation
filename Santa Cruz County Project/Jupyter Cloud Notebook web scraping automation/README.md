# Web scraping automation through jupyter cloud notebook
Developed a tool to automatically output an excel file with web query results filled in a desired column. To accomplish the task I wrote a R script on Kaggle jupyter cloud notebooks. The script takes the information(Addresses) from Property Address column; navigates to the desired website, performs a query on the website and extracts the results back into same spreadsheet.

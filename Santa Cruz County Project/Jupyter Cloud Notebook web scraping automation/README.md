# Web scraping automation with jupyter cloud notebook
Developed a tool to automatically output an excel file with web query results filled in a desired column. To accomplish the task I wrote a R script on Kaggle jupyter cloud notebook.
The script takes the information(Addresses) from Property Address column; submit a form with the address on the appropriate website(i.e. Propertyshark.com), performs a query
and extracts the results and store it to the new output file.

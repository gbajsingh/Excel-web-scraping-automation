# R web scraping automation
Wrote a script to extract "Property Addresses biodata" from website and store in excel. As the script is available on cloud it can be run from anywhere.

# Process
1. Script takes the information(Addresses) from spreadsheet.
2. Script submits a web-form (@Propertyshark.com).
3. Script extracts result and stores back in same spreadsheet.



*In case the script is interrupted while running, the script would pick up back from the same row it has stopped when ran again.

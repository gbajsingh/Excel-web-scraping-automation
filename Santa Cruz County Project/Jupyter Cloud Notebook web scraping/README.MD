# R web scraping
Wrote a script that extracts "Property Addresses biodata" from a website and saves it in excel. This R script is accesible and can be executed on Jupiter notebook.

# Flow work
1. Script takes the information(Addresses) from the spreadsheet.
2. Submits a web-form (@Propertyshark.com).
3. Extract the desired data from the reslting page and saves it back in the spreadsheet.



*In case the script is interrupted while running, the script would pick up back from the same row it has stopped when ran again.

# RStudio Cloud web scraping automation
Wrote a script that extract "Property Addresses biodata" from website and stores in excel. As the script is available on cloud it can be run from anywhere.

# Process
The script takes the information(Addresses) from Property Address column; submits a form with the address on the appropriate website(i.e. Propertyshark.com), performs a query;
and extracts the results to store it to a new file.



*In case of interruption while running the script, the script will pick up from where the row it has left when you rerun it.

# R web scraping
Wrote a script to extract "Property Addresses biodata" from website and save it in spreadsheet. Accesible from both Mac and windows OS.

# Process
1. Script takes the information(Addresses) from spreadsheet.
2. Submits a web-form (e.g. @Propertyshark.com).
3. Extracts desired data from resulting page and stores back into the same spreadsheet.



*In case the script is interrupted while running, the script would pick up back from the same row it has stopped when ran again.

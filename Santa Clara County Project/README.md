# RStudio Cloud web scraping automation
Wrote a script that extract "Property Addresses biodata" from website and stores in excel. As the script is available on cloud it can be run from anywhere.

# Process
1. Script takes the information(Addresses) from spreadsheet.
2. Script submits a web-form (@Propertyshark.com).
3. Script extracts results and  saves back in same spreadsheet.



*In case of interruption, while running the script, the script will pick up from where the row it has left when ran again.

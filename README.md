# Excel-web-scraping-automation

One of my client from upwork required a process to autofill the excel cells with web query result.  To accomplish this task I created a macro in excel by writing a Visual Basic script. The script takes the information(to performa web query) from range of selected cells; navigates to the desired website, performs a query on the website and extracts the results back into same spreadsheet corresponding cells.


Further, I've rewriten the script in R programming to make it compatible with cloud service so that user can access the script from any computer from anywhere.
